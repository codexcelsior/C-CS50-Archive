# Intro to my CS50 Computer Science Archive:
 
 First issue (SOLVED): cs50 lib not installed
Some problems you might come up while trying to install cs50 lib:
-> go to git of cs50 and install using terminal (It's much better using Linux)

Second issue (SOLVED): still cannot execute and solve get_string func?
-> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71507578/undefined-reference-to-get-string-compiling-cs50-code

Third issue:  [debug50: command not found] [UNRESOLVED/ SKIPPED] (If you cannot download it use the Codespace version of CS50)

NOTE: THIS IS ARCHIVE OF WHAT I LEARNT AND THE PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY OTHER PROJECTS!
